   abstract = {Purpose. Appropriate therapies for commonly encountered poisonings, medication overdoses, and other toxicological emergencies are reviewed, with discussion of pharmacists' role in ensuring their ready availability and proper use. Summary. Poisoning is the second leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States, with more than 2.4 million toxic exposures reported each year. Recently published national consensus guidelines recommend that hospitals providing emergency care routinely stock 24 antidotes for a wide range of toxicities, including toxic-alcohol poisoning, exposure to cyanide and other industrial agents, and intentional or unintentional overdoses of prescription medications (e.g., calcium-channel blockers, β-blockers, digoxin, isoniazid). Pharmacists can help reduce morbidity and mortality due to poisonings and overdoses by (1) recognizing the signs and symptoms of various types of toxic exposure, (2) guiding emergency room staff on the appropriate use of antidotes and supportive therapies, (3) helping to ensure appropriate monitoring of patients for antidote response and adverse effects, and (4) managing the procurement and stocking of antidotes to ensure their timely availability. Conclusion. Pharmacists can play a key role in reducing poisoning and overdose injuries and deaths by assisting in the early recognition of toxic exposures and guiding emergency personnel on the proper storage, selection, and use of antidotal therapies.

   abstract = {Combination cancer therapies aim to improve the probability and magnitude of therapeutic responses and reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance in an individual patient. However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations. This insight represents a different way to interpret trial data and a different way to design combination therapies. Patient-to-patient variability in response to single drugs is sufficient to explain the efficacy of a large number of combination cancer therapies without pharmacologically additive or synergistic effect in individual patients.},

@article{Mozgunov2021,
   abstract = {<p>There is growing interest in Phase I dose-finding studies studying several doses of more than one agent simultaneously. A number of combination dose-finding designs were recently proposed to guide escalation/de-escalation decisions during the trials. The majority of these proposals are model-based: a parametric combination-toxicity relationship is fitted as data accumulates. Various parameter shapes were considered but the unifying theme for many of these is that typically between 4 and 6 parameters are to be estimated. While more parameters allow for more flexible modelling of the combination-toxicity relationship, this is a challenging estimation problem given the typically small sample size in Phase I trials of between 20 and 60 patients. These concerns gave raise to an ongoing debate whether including more parameters into combination-toxicity model leads to more accurate combination selection. In this work, we extensively study two variants of a 4-parameter logistic model with reduced number of parameters to investigate the effect of modelling assumptions. A framework to calibrate the prior distributions for a given parametric model is proposed to allow for fair comparisons. Via a comprehensive simulation study, we have found that the inclusion of the interaction parameter between two compounds does not provide any benefit in terms of the accuracy of selection, on average, but is found to result in fewer patients allocated to the target combination during the trial.</p>},

@article{Mokhtari2017,
   abstract = {Combination therapy, a treatment modality that combines two or more therapeutic agents, is a cornerstone of cancer therapy. The amalgamation of anti-cancer drugs enhances efficacy compared to the mono-therapy approach because it targets key pathways in a characteristically synergistic or an additive manner. This approach potentially reduces drug resistance, while simultaneously providing therapeutic anti-cancer benefits, such as reducing tumour growth and metastatic potential, arresting mitotically active cells, reducing cancer stem cell populations, and inducing apoptosis. The 5-year survival rates for most metastatic cancers are still quite low, and the process of developing a new anti-cancer drug is costly and extremely time-consuming. Therefore, new strategies that target the survival pathways that provide efficient and effective results at an affordable cost are being considered. One such approach incorporates repurposing therapeutic agents initially used for the treatment of different diseases other than cancer. This approach is effective primarily when the FDA-approved agent targets similar pathways found in cancer. Because one of the drugs used in combination therapy is already FDA-approved, overall costs of combination therapy research are reduced. This increases cost efficiency of therapy, thereby benefiting the "medically underserved". In addition, an approach that combines repurposed pharmaceutical agents with other therapeutics has shown promising results in mitigating tumour burden. In this systematic review,},

@article{Abbas2020,
   abstract = {Background/Aims: In oncology, new combined treatments make it difficult to order dose levels according to monotonically increasing toxicity. New flexible dose-finding designs that take into account uncertainty in dose levels ordering were compared with classical designs through simulations in the setting of the monotonicity assumption violation. We give recommendations for the choice of dose-finding design. Methods: Motivated by a clinical trial for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, we considered designs that require a monotonicity assumption, the Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method, the modified Toxicity Probability Interval, the Bayesian Optimal Interval design, and designs that relax monotonicity assumption, the Bayesian Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method and the No Monotonicity Assumption design. We considered 15 scenarios including monotonic and non-monotonic dose–toxicity relationships among six dose levels. Results: The No Monotonicity Assumption and Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method designs were robust to the violation of the monotonicity assumption. Under non-monotonic scenarios, the No Monotonicity Assumption design selected the correct dose level more often than alternative methods on average. Under the majority of monotonic scenarios, the Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method selected the correct dose level more often than the No Monotonicity Assumption design. Other designs were impacted by the violation of the monotonicity assumption with a proportion of correct selections below 20% in most scenarios. Under monotonic scenarios, the highest proportions of correct selections were achieved using the Continual Reassessment Method and the Bayesian Optimal Interval design (between 52.8% and 73.1%). The costs of relaxing the monotonicity assumption by the No Monotonicity Assumption design and Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method were decreases in the proportions of correct selections under monotonic scenarios ranging from 5.3% to 20.7% and from 1.4% to 16.1%, respectively, compared with the best performing design and were higher proportions of patients allocated to toxic dose levels during the trial. Conclusions: Innovative oncology treatments may no longer follow monotonic dose levels ordering which makes standard phase I methods fail. In such a setting, appropriate designs, as the No Monotonicity Assumption or Partial Ordering Continual Reassessment Method designs, should be used to safely determine recommended for phase II dose.},

The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of dose-finding experimentation with the ethical demands of established medical practice. It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little interest. Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating experimentation at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this level. Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally (i.e., around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity level) they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic response. Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple one. Extensive simulations show the model to have real promise.]},

In this article, we introduce a new trial design, the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design. The BOIN design is easy to implement in a way similar to the 3 + 3 design, but is more flexible for choosing the target toxicity rate and cohort size and yields a substantially better performance that is comparable with that of more complex model-based designs. The BOIN design contains the 3 + 3 design and the accelerated titration design as special cases, thus linking itto established phase I approaches. A numerical study shows that the BOIN design generally outperforms the 3 + 3 design and the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design. The BOIN design is more likely than the 3 + 3 design to correctly select the MTD and allocate more patients to the MTD. Compared with the mTPI design, the BOIN design has a substantially lower risk of overdosing patients and generally a higher probability of correctly selecting the MTD. User-friendly software is freely available to facilitate the application of the BOIN design.},

   abstract = {Drug combination therapy has become the mainstream approach to cancer treatment. One fundamental feature that makes combination trials different from single-agent trials is the existence of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) contour, that is, multiple MTDs. As a result, unlike single-agent phase I trials, which aim to find a single MTD, it is often of interest to find the MTD contour for combination trials. We propose a new dose-finding design, the waterfall design, to find the MTD contour for drug combination trials. Taking the divide-and-conquer strategy, the waterfall design divides the task of finding the MTD contour into a sequence of one-dimensional dose-finding processes, known as subtrials. The subtrials are conducted sequentially in a certain order, such that the results of each subtrial will be used to inform the design of subsequent subtrials. Such information borrowing allows the waterfall design to explore the two-dimensional dose space efficiently using a limited sample size and decreases the chance of overdosing and underdosing patients. To accommodate the consideration that doses on the MTD contour may have very different efficacy or synergistic effects because of drug–drug interaction, we further extend our approach to a phase I/II design with the goal of finding the MTD with the highest efficacy. Simulation studies show that the waterfall design is safer and has higher probability of identifying the true MTD contour than some existing designs. The R package “BOIN” to implement the waterfall design is freely available from CRAN. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The entire dose-finding procedure is nonparametric (model-free), which is thus robust and also does not require the typical "nonparametric" prephase used in model-based designs for drug-combination trials. The proposed two-dimensional interval design enjoys convergence properties for large samples. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method under various scenarios and further make a modication to estimate toxicity contours by parallel dose-finding paths.

   abstract = {Much of the statistical methodology underlying the experimental design of phase 1 trials in oncology is intended for studies involving a single cytotoxic agent. The goal of these studies is to estimate the maximally tolerated dose, the highest dose that can be administered with an acceptable level of toxicity. A fundamental assumption of these methods is monotonicity of the dose-toxicity curve. This is a reasonable assumption for single-agent trials in which the administration of greater doses of the agent can be expected to produce dose-limiting toxicities in increasing proportions of patients. When studying multiple agents, the assumption may not hold because the ordering of the toxicity probabilities could possibly be unknown for several of the available drug combinations. At the same time, some of the orderings are known and so we describe the whole situation as that of a partial ordering. In this article, we propose a new two-dimensional dose-finding method for multiple-agent trials that simplifies to the continual reassessment method (CRM), introduced by O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher (1990,Biometrics46, 33-48), when the ordering is fully known. This design enables us to relax the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity curve. We compare our approach and some simulation results to a CRM design in which the ordering is known as well as to other suggestions for partial orders. © 2011, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {At the time that Paracelsus coined his famous dictum, ‘What is there that is not poison? All things are poison and nothing is without poison. Solely the dose determines that a thing is not a poison', embryonic toxicology was a fairly focused discipline that mainly dealt with occupational poisonings and side effects of pharmaceuticals, such as mercury. While Paracelsus paved the way for the modern threshold concept and the no-adverse effect level, modern-day toxicology is now tussling with highly complex issues, such as developmental exposures, genetic predisposition and other sources of hypersusceptibility, multiple causes of underestimated toxicity, and the continuous presence of uncertainty, even in regard to otherwise well-studied mercury compounds. Further, the wealth of industrial chemicals now challenges the ‘untested-chemical assumption', that the lack of documentation means that toxic potentials can be ignored. Unfortunately, in its ambition to provide solid evidence, toxicology has been pushed into almost endless replications, as evidenced by the thousands of toxicology publications every year that focus on toxic metals, including mercury, while less well-known hazards are ignored. From a public health viewpoint, toxicology needs to provide better guidance on decision-making under ever-present uncertainty. In this role, we need to learn from the stalwart Paracelsus the insistence on relying on facts rather than authority alone to protect against chemical hazards.},

abstract = {Phase I clinical trials are an essential step in the development of anticancer drugs. The main goal of these studies is to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of new drugs or drug combinations for phase II trials. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Here we review dose escalation methods for phase I trials, including the rule-based and model-based dose escalation methods that have been developed to evaluate new anticancer agents. Toxicity has traditionally been the primary endpoint for phase I trials involving cytotoxic agents. However, with the emergence of molecularly targeted anticancer agents, potential alternative endpoints to delineate optimal biological activity, such as plasma drug concentration and target inhibition in tumor or surrogate tissues, have been proposed along with new trial designs. We also describe specific methods for drug combinations as well as methods that use a time-to-event endpoint or both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints. Finally, we present the advantages and drawbacks of the various dose escalation methods and discuss specific applications of the methods in developmental oncotherapeutics. 2009 The Author(s).2009This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/uk/), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

@article{Babb1998,
abstract = {We describe an adaptive dose escalation scheme for use in cancer phase I clinical trials. The method is fully adaptive, makes use of all the information available at the time of each dose assignment, and directly addresses the ethical need to control the probability of overdosing. It is designed to approach the maximum tolerated dose as fast as possible subject to the constraint that the predicted proportion of patients who receive an overdose does not exceed a specified value. We conducted simulations to compare the proposed method with four up-and-down designs, two stochastic approximation methods, and with a variant of the continual reassessment method. The results showed the proposed method effective as a means to control the frequency of overdosing. Relative to the continual reassessment method, our scheme overdosed a smaller proportion of patients, exhibited fewer toxicities and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with comparable accuracy. When compared to the non-parametric schemes, our method treated fewer patients at either subtherapeutic or severely toxic dose levels, treated more patients at optimal dose levels and estimated the maximum tolerated dose with smaller average bias and mean squared error. Hence, the proposed method is promising alternative to currently used cancer phase I clinical trial designs.},

@article{Thall2003,
abstract = {We propose an adaptive two-stage Bayesian design for finding one or more acceptable dose combinations of two cytotoxic agents used together in a Phase I clinical trial. The method requires that each of the two agents has been studied previously as a single agent, which is almost invariably the case in practice. A parametric model is assumed for the probability of toxicity as a function of the two doses. Informative priors for parameters characterizing the single-agent toxicity probability curves are either elicited from the physician(s) planning the trial or obtained from historical data, and vague priors are assumed for parameters characterizing two-agent interactions. A method for eliciting the single-agent parameter priors is described. The design is applied to a trial of gemcitabine and cyclophosphamide, and a simulation study is presented.},

@article{Neuenschwander2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Statistical Association. Historical data are important for the design of a clinical trial. Yet these data are rarely used in the analysis of the actual trial. While justifiable in certain situations, ignoring historical data can lead to less accurate inferences, and, therefore, suboptimal decisions. After a review of the main approaches to using historical data, the framework is extended to co-data, which comprise all relevant (historical and concurrent) trial-external data. These data can be used for the inference of the parameter in the actual trial via meta-analytic approaches. While the use of co-data in clinical trials is attractive, it is also ambitious. For example, avoiding undue weight of co-data (relative to actual trial data) is important, which can often be achieved by plausible assumptions about between-trial heterogeneity and allowance for nonexchangeability across trial parameters. Two applications with co-data will be discussed: phase III trials with interim decisions informed by co-data; and, a phase I combination trial in Oncology, which takes advantage of co-data from completed and ongoing phase I trials.},
